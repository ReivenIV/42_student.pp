Welcome to my 42.pp student repository 2024!

This repository includes my solutions for the C programming exercises as part of the **42 student** (after piscine) program. Here, you'll find various tasks and projects I completed to deepen my understanding of low-level programming.

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise or project. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- **Source code**: `.c` files with my solutions
- **README** files (if applicable): Brief explanations of the exercises and any notable approaches used

## About the 42 student
The **42 student** is an intensive prigram by [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage) designed to teach programming, working in group, time managment, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking with a focus on C programming.

## Contributing
